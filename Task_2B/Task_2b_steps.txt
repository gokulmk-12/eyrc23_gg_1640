Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2B. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1.We first expanded the image database by augmeting the available images 
2.The we built a model using ResNet18 bysusing transfer learning 
3.Then trained it for 15 epochs least loss of training data
4.adjusted the learning rate rate accordingly 
5.tested on testing data to find whether overifttingor underfitting
